# Introduction

The following articles describe how you can install and use the library.

The library supports both NET Standard 2.0 and Net 5.

Unless a version is indicated as a pre-release, the library has been thoroughly tested and is thus ready for use in production.

For details of the specification, please consult the [Details of the Asset Administration Shell v3].
